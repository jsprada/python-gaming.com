Feel free to make a pull request to a change you see that would better the website and community. 

###Goals
The goal of this site is to make navigating documentation easier to find and view. This is a direct result of the recent changes to pygame.org. But this site is inviting to any Python gaming library. 

1) Easy to find and complete Documentation <br>
2) Easy to find and complete Downloads <br>
3) Forums (communication hub) <br>
4) Projects (a section where everyone can upload their games and show them off) <br>

###Contribution
You can help the project in numerous ways. Post an issue of your problem/error/missing tool, etc.

#####Testing
Only so much testing can be done by admins. And users may see things differently than the creators of the page. 

1) Check for typos in documentation, missing docs, or additions that should be added. Is anything out of the ordinary?<br>
2) Create project pages and ensure that you have the tools you need to showcase your games. Check that everything works and that you can do so at ease. <br>
3) Review the Forums and ensure that everything is available that you feel is needed. <br>
4) 

#####Additions
Currently, only pygame exists. Other libraries need to be filled in. Any GUI that makes a game in Python is welcome here.
