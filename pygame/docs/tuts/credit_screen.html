Credit screens can be created different ways and with complicated aspects. Here we are going to teach a simple plain "end of movie" screen. Where text flows from the bottom to the top of the screen. 
</p>

<pre class="brush: python; title: 'Codebox Title'">
import pygame as pg

pg.init()

text_list = '''I'm Henry the eighth, I am
Henry the eighth, I am, I am
I got married to the widow next door
She's been married seven times before

And every one was an Henry (Henry)
She wouldn't have a Willy or a Sam (No Sam)
I'm her eighth old man, I'm Henry
Henry the eighth I am

Second verse, same as the first

I'm Henry the eighth, I am
Henry the eighth, I am, I am
I got married to the widow next door
She's been married seven times before

And every one was an Henry (Henry)
She wouldn't have a Willy or a Sam (No Sam)
I'm her eighth old man, I'm Henry
Henry the eighth I am

I'm Henry the eighth, I am
Henry the eighth, I am, I am
I got married to the widow next door
She's been married seven times before

And every one was an Henry (Henry)
She wouldn't have a Willy or a Sam (No Sam)
I'm her eighth old man, I'm Henry
Henry the eighth I am

H-E-N-R-Y
Henry (Henry)
Henry (Henry)
Henry the eighth I am, I am
Henry the eighth I am
Yeah!

<p>
Here we have the variable text_list which is a docstring. Normally you dont use docstrings within code and utilize them as strings. But they are strings. And you can do with them what you can with regular strings. And the reason I used docstrings is because I copied the text from online and didnt want to convert it into a list the normal way (where each line has quotation marks following with a comma, etc.) Because docstrings are strings, we can use string methods on them. So at the
very end of the docstring we use the split method to split the docstring into a list separated by newlines ('\n').
